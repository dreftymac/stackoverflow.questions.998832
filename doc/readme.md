## Overview

### Grand Vision 

A runnable, user-friendly and intuitive "programmable-github-equivalent".

### A Metaphor
A spreadsheet that can deal with arbitrary data structures, not just columns and rows.
A spreadhseet that can authenticate, audit-trail, and revision-history, every element of the system.
   * user input
   * user input validation routines
   * function input
   * function output
   * function code integrity

### Outline

* grand vision ;; something equivalent to a "programmable github"
    * code capable of authentication and auditability
    * code results capable of authentication and auditability
    * human-provided input capable of authentication and auditability

* simple to use by people without high technical proficiency
* universal interchange format, everything is just JSON and references to runnable code
* the JSON can come from human input or an automated agent interchangeably, there is no difference

* the intuitive-json-entry is a key element because if you can get non-technical people doing technical things, the potential scope of inputs to your system expand exponentially
* "wikipedia" vs "citizendium" 
    * increasing the range and variety of potential editors will unambiguously increase the range and variety of quality and breadth of content ... auditing and quality control are built-in through data validation and checksums

* flexible input modality
    * need to be able to handle spreadsheets (as the bare minimum prerequisite UI metaphor), possibly as the common denominator for most complex interface to give to non technical users
